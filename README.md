- **Cursor** – [Cursor.so](https://cursor.so) – An AI-enabled code editor that integrates with Codex and other models to provide code autocompletion, chat-based assistance, and project-wide refactoring in a standalone development environment.
- **GitHub Copilot** – [Official Site](https://github.com/features/copilot) – AI pair programming assistant developed by GitHub and powered by OpenAI Codex. Integrates into VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, Neovim, and more (commercial subscription service).
- **OpenAI Codex CLI** – [GitHub: openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) – Official CLI for Codex that allows natural-language coding workflows in your terminal. You can run commands like `codex` to spin up the Codex agent locally, execute code, run tests, and iterate on tasks via prompts.
- **OpenAI Codex VS Code Extension** – [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt) – Official extension bringing Codex into Visual Studio Code (and other VS Code-based editors). Provides a chat panel and supports delegating larger tasks to Codex in the cloud (requires an OpenAI ChatGPT Plus/Pro account).
- **Replit Code Explainer** – [Replit Blog](https://blog.replit.com/codex-explainer) – Replit’s implementation of Codex to provide an “Explain Code” feature. Allows users to highlight code (in JavaScript or Python) and get plain-English explanations generated by Codex.
- **Vim Codex** – [GitHub: tom-doerr/vim_codex](https://github.com/tom-doerr/vim_codex) – Vim/Neovim plugin that enables AI code completion and assistance from OpenAI Codex directly within the editor.
- **Zsh Codex** – [GitHub: tom-doerr/zsh_codex](https://github.com/tom-doerr/zsh_codex) – Z shell plugin that lets you use OpenAI Codex in your terminal. Write a comment or prompt in your shell, and Codex will generate the corresponding shell commands or code to accomplish the task.

## Projects & Applications

- **Cogram** – *(Codex for Data Science)* – A Y Combinator-backed startup that built a coding assistant for data scientists. It used Codex to translate plain English queries into complex SQL and to autocomplete code in Jupyter notebooks (supporting Python, Julia, SQL). *Note:* Cogram’s early beta (2021) showcased Codex-driven autocompletion for data analysis tasks in notebooks.
- **Computational Chemistry CLI** – *Experimental* – A prototype command-line interface that uses natural language (powered by Codex) to perform computational chemistry tasks. An example of applying Codex in a scientific domain: users can request chemistry computations or analyses in plain English and receive generated code or results.
- **Figstack** – [Figstack.com](https://www.figstack.com) – A Codex-powered application for explaining, translating, and documenting code. Figstack provides an AI assistant (via web app and VS Code extension) that can answer questions about code, generate documentation or comments, and translate code between languages using Codex.
- **OpenAI Codex Demos** – [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyqLe7vGDd2P4ET-9YmxdFZmxDZ5dDW98) – A collection of short demo videos showcasing Codex’s capabilities (from the early Codex beta). Demos include code generation from natural language, building simple games, manipulating UIs, and more.
- **Streamlit Codex Demo** – [Tweet Example](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1427338182930774024) – A demonstration of using Codex with Streamlit to analyze and visualize data via natural language. Shows how Codex can generate Python data analysis code from plain English requests (e.g., plotting a chart from a description).
