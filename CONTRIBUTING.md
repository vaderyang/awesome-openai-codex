# Contributing to Awesome OpenAI Codex

Thank you for contributing to **Awesome OpenAI Codex**! We welcome additions of new resources and improvements to existing entries. Before submitting, please review the guidelines below to ensure your contribution fits the project's style and quality standards.

## What to Contribute

- **Relevant Content**: We include projects, tools, libraries, demos, and learning materials **directly related to OpenAI Codex**. This includes official OpenAI Codex resources, third-party integrations or clients, applications built on Codex, and educational articles/videos about Codex. Please avoid suggesting resources that are unrelated or only tangentially related to Codex.
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Our goal is to curate the *best* and most useful resources. Before adding a resource, consider its usefulness, popularity, and maintenance status. For code repositories, preference is given to those that are well-documented and actively maintained.

## How to Add a New Entry

1. **Check for Duplicates**: Search the list (and open PRs) to ensure the resource isn't already included or proposed.
2. **Choose the Right Category**: Identify the appropriate section (e.g. *Tools & Integrations*, *Projects & Applications*, *Learning Resources*). If none fits, you may propose a new category, but generally new items should belong to an existing section.
3. **Use the Proper Format**: Each entry should follow this format (Markdown bullet):
   ```markdown
   - **Project Name** – [Homepage or Repo](URL) – Short description of the project.
